# Simple Discord Chatbot

The AI uses OpenAI `gpt-3.5-turbo` ( you can edit this in the code though ) and streams its responses to chat. 
The bot is meant to be a fun addition to your Discord Server, and is meant to be used by a group of users at the same time.

## Customization
You can set the bot to only listen in a specific channel and or listen to users with specific roles. 
You can further customize the AI parameters itself in the `config.ts` file.

## Instructions

1. Provide `.env`<br>
Add a `.env` file, and add the required variables that can be found in `env.example.txt`.

2. Edit `config.ts`<br>
You can edit the bot accordingly in `config.ts` to provide specific parameters and instructions.
